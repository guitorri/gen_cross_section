# This file defines the layer information - position, colour and when it
# should be displayed.
# They are drawn in order, starting from the top, so it is probably best to
# have the low down layers at the top of the list.
# 
# Each entry is of the form:
#
#LayerStart: Name
#YBottom: 100
#YTop: 100
#Colour: 0
#Rule: rule
#LayerEnd
#
# Name doesn't do anything at the moment, it is just for making our lives
# easier.
# YBottom and YTop control where that layer will be drawn.
# Colour controls what colour is used - it is the index of the palette from
# palette.txt.
# Rule controls the conditions under which the layer will be drawn.
# It is quite delicate as I'm not very clever :)
#
# Rules for Rules
# ===============
#
# The ! (NOT) && (AND) and || (OR) operators are supported.
# Up to two layers can be used in a rule.
# There must be a space between the operator and the layer.
# Brackets () aren't supported.
#
# If you need more complicated rules or can help improve the rule handling
# code (see layers.c check_rule()), please get in touch.
#
# Rule Examples
# =============
#
# Rule: A (only draw this layer if A is present)
# Rule: ! A (only draw this layer if A is not present)
# Rule: A && B (only draw this layer if both A and B are present)
# Rule: A || ! B (only draw this layer if A is present or B is not present)
